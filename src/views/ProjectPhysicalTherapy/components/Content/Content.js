        When I was 18, I accepted the Martin Luther King Jr. academic scholarship and committed to an accelerated 6-year doctorate program in physical therapy at Saint Louis University. I would complete my Bachelor of Science degree in Exercise Science with a Minor degree in Psychology. While I would not complete the entire graduate program, I would ultimately accomplish a lot.

        I was voted Class Representative to represent my class of 90+ students. In this role, I discussed and voted on program changes in the Physical Therapy Student Council. In addition, I contributed to discussions and decisions of the program advisory board.

        I served as a manuscript reviewer for the Journal of Student Physical Therapy where I appraised the writing and technical excellence of research manuscripts and evaluated the overall importance of physical therapy studies.

        I served as a principal investigative assistant for Dr. Mark Reinking, Dr. Tricia Austin, Dr. Jason Bennett, Dr. Ann Hayes, and Dr. William Mitchell. We discovered risk factors for the development of lower extremity overuse bone injury in athletes, as further described <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387723/" style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>here</a>.

        I completed my last clinical rotation in the physical therapy clinic at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee. In the mornings, I would shadow my mentor and eventually work semi-independently with patients with complex central nervous system injuries in an inpatient setting. In the afternoons, I would shadow my mentor and eventually work semi-independently with patients with orthopedic injuries in an outpatient setting. My mentor taught a weekly class to veterans on how to mitigate their back pain through therapy and in their activities of daily living; on one occasion I taught the class on the anatomy of the spine and the role of therapeutic exercises in the progress of treatment.

        Ultimately, my passion for computer science overshadowed my interest in physical therapy. So I created my own <a target="_blank" href="/computer-science" style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>computer science education program</a>, left the physical therapy program, and took steps towards my ensuing software engineering career.
